# weather-dash-2

## Description 

We were given a challenge to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. We were 
to use the 5 Day Weather Forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities. The searched data will be persistent so the user can see which cities they have looked up when the page refreshes.


The user story for this project is:

As a ... traveler</br>
I want ... to see the weather outlook for multiple cities</br>
So that ... I can plan a trip accordingly</br>

The acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs</br>
WHEN I search for a city</br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history</br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city</br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions,</br> 
the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed</br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city</br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation</br> 
of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity</br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history</br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city</br>
